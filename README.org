#+TITLE: Watchy Template

This represents my basic template for starting a [[https://watchy.sqfmi.com/][Watchy]] face using the [[https://platformio.org/][PlatformIO]] development environment.

The basic Watchy instructions come from the [[https://watchy.sqfmi.com/docs/getting-started/][getting started]] page. 

The structure of this repo is that structure generated by running
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pio project init --board esp32dev
#+END_SRC

and then editing the platformio.ini file to include the Watchy library.

To use this repo, clone it, cd into the directory and then run
#+begin_src sh
./setup_7seg.sh
#+end_src
which will grab the required dependencies, as described in the getting started page, copy the 7_SEG watch face code over and then build it.

Finally you can upload it to the watch with 
#+begin_src sh
pio run -t upload
#+end_src
